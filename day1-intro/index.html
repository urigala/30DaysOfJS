        I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
        Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
        In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
        to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
        It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
        Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \
        I hope you are enjoying too."
